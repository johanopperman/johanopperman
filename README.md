### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My focus is on Quality Assurance, contributing to user stories
during grooming and ensuring a full understanding of the user
requirements. I am working in an Agile environment, applying testing
techniques on developed stories and ensure all findings are raised to
the team. During Sprint planning represent test effort estimation and
add input on possible testing scenarios. During active Sprint, create/
update test cases, pair testing with the developer, execute test cases
and report.
Frontend testing: User Acceptance testing
Automation: C#, xUnit
Backend testing: Application Programming Interface (API) testing
with Postman and Jmeter (Automation of user flows)
Platforms: Web cross browsers, iOS apps, Android apps
